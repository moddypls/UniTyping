# UniTyping
An AutoHotKey v2 script that lets you write unicode characters with your keyboard.

When it is active you can write unicode characters using % as a prefix followed by the hexadecimal unicode number of the character you want to type.
You can cancel it using [SPACE].

Example:

  For writing `f: x ↦ x²` you have to type `f: x %21a6 x²`
